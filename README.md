# PeopleSwiftUI
This is a sample iOS application which used SwiftUI with MVVM implementation

This app is developed to learn SwiftUI with MVVM design pattern.
Here I have used a free REST API https://reqres.in/ 

Application Includes Three main screens of 

People - Listing people on a GridView 
Details - Get more details on a specific person 
Create - Create a new person with their details. Please note API doesn't add to people grid view after successfully added a new user.

App inludes Unit test cases for almost all the logics and integrations

App includes UI Testing only for the People screen

I haven't used any 3rd party libraries in this project.
